# mqtt-to-telegram
A container reacting to a topic on MQTT by pushing a notification to Telegram.

## Telegram BOT

1. Creating the Bot (Getting the Token)
The "father" of all bots is @BotFather. Follow these steps within the Telegram app:
  * Search for **@BotFather** in the Telegram search bar and start the conversation.
  * Type or click the `/newbot` command.
  * Name: Choose a display name (e.g., `MyMqttBot`).
  * Username: Choose a unique username that must end with "bot" (e.g., `mqtt_to_telegram_bot`).
  * Token: BotFather will reply with a message containing the **HTTP API Token** (a string similar to `123456789:ABCdefGhI_jklmNoP`). Save it, as it is the key to controlling the bot.

2. Getting your Chat ID
The bot needs to know who to send messages to. The `Chat ID` is the unique numeric code for your account.
  * Search for the @userinfobot bot on Telegram and click "Start."
  * It will immediately respond with your ID (a number, e.g., `987654321`).

Important: Now open a chat with your new bot (the one you created in step 1) and click **"Start"** If you don't start it, the bot won't have permission to message you.

## Testing MQTT
You can test the setup by sending a manual message to the MQTT broker (remember to `apt install mosquitto-clients`)
```
mosquitto_pub \                                                                                                                        
        -h ${SERVER} \                                                                                                                 
        -p 1883 \                                                                                                                      
        -u ${USERNAME} \

        -t "telegram/helloworld" \
